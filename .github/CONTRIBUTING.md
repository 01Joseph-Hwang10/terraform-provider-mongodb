# Contributing to `terraform-provider-mongodb`

Contributions are always welcome. Before contributing please read the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) & [search the issue tracker](https://github.com/01Joseph-Hwang10/terraform-provider-mongodb/issues); Your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in master. To contribute, [fork](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository, commit your changes, & [send a pull request](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).


## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from a base branch (e.g. `master`), and merge back against that branch.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first, and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:

  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log (e.g. `fix: some commit message notes some fixes (fix #3899)`).
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR. GitHub can automatically squash them before merging.

- Make sure tests pass!

- Ensure that you have installed dev dependencies so that you benefit from linting & formatting tools.

- PR title must follow the form of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so that changelogs can be automatically generated.
